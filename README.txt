You must run chmod +x tm.py to make the script 
executable within a linux environment. 

To exectue the program, you run the script in the terminal as such along with the rules txt file and also the input txt file. The program is coded to handle command line arguments.

./tm.py M2.txt M2-Accept.txt

The TM that I have programmed can handle being both a language recognizer or a computation
machine. The student-developed machine that I have created is the former (a language recognizer).
When you run the student machine, the input test file contains 5 strings that should be accepted
by the machine and also 4 strings that should be rejected by the machine.

All the outputs can be seen in the OutputDump folder.
